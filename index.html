                <p>When your account is created, you'll want to adjust your notifications so you only receive the information you want. For instance, 
                    you can choose to receive notifications when you get likes from everyone — but, alternatively, you might decide to only receive 
                    notifications when you get a like from someone you follow. Or, you might turn off notifications for likes altogether.</p>
